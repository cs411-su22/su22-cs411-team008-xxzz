## Project Summary
The goal of this project is to build a database-supported web application that allows users to freely explore TV shows and movies. We will start from both the front-end and back-end to build up an interactive web application. 

The dataset for this project is collected from Kaggle. Each row will have show/movie information such as title, cast, director, etc. Some basic functionalities for our web application include search, filter, and add shows/movies to each user’s “favorite” list. Some interesting features will allow users to compare two shows/movies and also write their own reviews.
